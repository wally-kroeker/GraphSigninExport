# Active Context

## Current Development Focus

We are currently implementing the core functionality of the GraphReporter project. The development environment is configured with UV (Astral), and we have successfully implemented both authentication with Microsoft Graph API and the first data export functionality.

### Completed Tasks

- Established the project directory structure
- Created initial documentation:
  - Product Requirements Document
  - Architecture Documentation
  - Technical Documentation
  - Tasks Plan
- Set up development environment:
  - Initialized Git repository with proper .gitignore
  - Created pyproject.toml for modern Python packaging
  - Set up UV virtual environment
  - Generated requirements files using UV
  - Configured development tools (black, isort, flake8)
  - Set up pytest for testing
- Implemented authentication:
  - Created AuthClient using azure-identity
  - Set up client credentials flow
  - Successfully tested Graph API connection
  - Verified organization access
- Implemented sign-in logs export:
  - Created SignInLogsClient for retrieving audit logs
  - Added filtering by date range, application, and user
  - Implemented CSV export functionality
  - Created example scripts for different export scenarios

### In Progress

- Enhancing reporting capabilities
- Adding more Graph API data sources
- Improving error handling and token management

### Next Steps

1. Enhance Authentication Module
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Implement token caching and management
   - Add more test cases for error scenarios

2. Expand Graph API Client Implementation
   - Add more report types (users, devices, applications)
   - Implement additional filtering options
   - Improve data transformation and formatting

3. Improve Export Functionality
   - Add support for more export formats (Excel, JSON)
   - Implement data visualization options
   - Add scheduling capability for recurring reports

## Current Decisions and Considerations

- Using UV (Astral) as the primary Python environment manager
- Using azure-identity and msgraph-sdk for Microsoft Graph integration
- Successfully implemented app-only authentication using client credentials flow
- Successfully implemented sign-in logs export with flexible filtering options
- Planning to expand to more Microsoft Graph data endpoints
- Planning for efficient data retrieval and pagination handling

## Known Issues and Challenges

- Need to handle large datasets efficiently with pagination
- Token management needs careful implementation for security
- Error handling should be comprehensive yet user-friendly
- Need to ensure proper handling of API rate limits
- Need to provide flexible data filtering options for all report types
