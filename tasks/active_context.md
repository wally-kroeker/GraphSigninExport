# Active Context

## Current Development Focus

We are currently in the initial phase of the GraphReporter project, setting up the project structure and basic architecture. The project aims to create a Python-based CLI tool for retrieving and reporting data from Microsoft Graph API.

### Completed Tasks

- Established the project directory structure
- Created initial documentation:
  - Product Requirements Document
  - Architecture Documentation
  - Technical Documentation
  - Tasks Plan

### In Progress

- Setting up the project development environment
- Creating the initial project structure
- Defining core modules and their interfaces
- Implementing the configuration management system

### Next Steps

1. Initialize the project structure
   - Create basic module skeleton
   - Set up virtual environment
   - Add requirements.txt with initial dependencies

2. Implement the authentication module
   - Create the AuthClient using MSAL
   - Set up client credentials flow
   - Implement token management

3. Develop the base Graph client
   - Implement the main client interface
   - Add pagination handling
   - Set up error management

## Current Decisions and Considerations

- We've decided to use typer for the CLI interface due to its modern API and ease of use
- We're implementing a modular architecture to allow for easy extension in the future
- We're focusing on a clean, maintainable codebase with comprehensive testing
- We're prioritizing security in credential management and token handling

## Known Issues and Challenges

- Need to handle large datasets efficiently with pagination
- Token management needs careful implementation for security
- Error handling should be comprehensive yet user-friendly
- Need to ensure the tool works properly with various permission configurations
