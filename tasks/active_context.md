# Active Context

## Current Development Focus

We are currently implementing the core functionality of the GraphReporter project. The development environment is configured with UV (Astral), and basic authentication with Microsoft Graph API is now working successfully.

### Completed Tasks

- Established the project directory structure
- Created initial documentation:
  - Product Requirements Document
  - Architecture Documentation
  - Technical Documentation
  - Tasks Plan
- Set up development environment:
  - Initialized Git repository with proper .gitignore
  - Created pyproject.toml for modern Python packaging
  - Set up UV virtual environment
  - Generated requirements files using UV
  - Configured development tools (black, isort, flake8)
  - Set up pytest for testing
- Implemented authentication:
  - Created AuthClient using azure-identity
  - Set up client credentials flow
  - Successfully tested Graph API connection
  - Verified organization access

### In Progress

- Expanding authentication test coverage
- Implementing error handling and token management
- Planning Graph API data retrieval implementation

### Next Steps

1. Enhance Authentication Module
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Implement token caching and management
   - Add more test cases for error scenarios

2. Begin Graph API Client Implementation
   - Design base client interface
   - Implement pagination handling
   - Set up error management
   - Add data retrieval methods

3. Plan Data Export Features
   - Design export formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)
   - Plan data transformation logic
   - Consider performance optimizations

## Current Decisions and Considerations

- Using UV (Astral) as the primary Python environment manager
- Using azure-identity and msgraph-sdk for Microsoft Graph integration
- Successfully implemented app-only authentication using client credentials flow
- Focusing on robust error handling and token management
- Planning for efficient data retrieval and pagination

## Known Issues and Challenges

- Need to handle large datasets efficiently with pagination
- Token management needs careful implementation for security
- Error handling should be comprehensive yet user-friendly
- Need to ensure proper handling of API rate limits
